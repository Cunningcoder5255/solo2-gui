# Solo2 GUI
Solo2 GUI is a GUI frontent for the solo2 command line application written in rust. Solo2 GUI is primarily intended to provide easy access to TOTP OATH functions, which are not easily accessible through other applications the way FIDO is. In the future, Solo2 GUI will also implement other solo2 command line functions like FIDO and key updating.

## Use
run `git clone https://github.com/Cunningcoder5255/solo2-gui.git && cd solo2-gui && cargo run --release` to build and run solo2-gui.
